I like to fiddle around and code every once in a while.<br/>
At the moment, I'm having a lot of fun working with Python and scripting Powershell tools.
<hr/>

Some languages I know:
* Python
* Powershell
* Java
* C++

Languages I want to improve on:
* HTML (It's been around 5 years since I've worked with HTML)
* CSS (Know a little bit through exploring the web and customization)

Plans:
* Build my [github.io webpage](https://sterling-tenn.github.io/) - [(Repository Here)](https://github.com/sterling-tenn/sterling-tenn.github.io)
* Learn Javascript
* Learn C/C#
